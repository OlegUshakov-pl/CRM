# CRM

## Description

This CRM system is designed around two primary goals that help keep engineering and project documentation structured, accessible, and easy to manage.

## 1. Centralized storage for all project‑related documents

Each project can contain everything required throughout its lifecycle:

- photos  
- technical drawings  
- documentation  
- notes  
- any additional files  

When you save a project to a selected location, the system automatically creates a **project folder with a unique number**. Inside this folder, all files are neatly organized into dedicated subdirectories, ensuring a clean and consistent project structure.

If you need to archive or transfer a project, you can simply **export it as a ZIP file** and move it wherever necessary.

---

## 2. Unified library for general documentation

The CRM also provides a structured space for collecting various types of information:

- documents  
- videos  
- articles  
- external resources  

You can even save articles **directly from the internet using their URLs**.  
All collected materials are stored in well‑organized folders, forming a clean and accessible knowledge base.

---

## File Storage

### Projects

Projects store files in organized directories:

```
{number}_{name}_Project/
  documents/
  drawings/
  models/
```

Subfolder naming is configurable via `AppSetting`. Storage backend uses custom `ProjectFileSystemStorage`.

### Library Articles

Articles are auto-saved as Markdown (`.md`) files on disk for portability:

```
{library_root}/
  {slug}_{YYYY-MM-DD}/
    {slug}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md    # Full article content in Markdown
    images/                    # Downloaded/copied article images
    attachments/               # Uploaded file attachments
```

- Content is stored both in the database (HTML) and as `.md` on disk
- Storage root is configurable via `AppSetting` (falls back to `MEDIA_ROOT/library/`)
- Article folders are created on create/edit/import and recursively deleted on delete
- Images are served via a dedicated `/library/{slug}/image/{path}` view with path traversal protection
