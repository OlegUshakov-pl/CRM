Key Features:

Project and task management

Material and BOM tracking

Support for engineering files (DXF, STEP, STL)

Centralized document storage

Knowledge base split into Articles, Gallery, and Files

AI assistant for automation and team support

Fast HTMX‑based interface without a heavy frontend

Purpose:
To give small industrial companies a simple, fast, and local ERP‑level tool that can be deployed without complex infrastructure.

## Product Description

### Goal 1: Centralized Project Documentation

Every project gets its own dedicated space. As soon as a project is created, you can start adding everything related to it:

- Photos
- Drawings and technical documents
- Notes
- Any other supporting files

Once the project is saved to a chosen location, the system automatically generates a numbered project folder. All documents belonging to that project are neatly organized inside, each type kept in its own subfolder — no manual sorting required.

When a project is finished, it can be archived and moved out of the active workspace, keeping the working area clean while preserving a complete, organized record for future reference.

### Goal 2: A Central Library for Reference Materials

Beyond individual projects, the CRM also serves as a knowledge base for general documentation the business collects over time:

- Documents
- Videos
- Articles

Articles can be saved directly from the internet via a link, making it easy to build a personal reference library without manual copy-pasting. As with projects, all saved materials are automatically organized into clearly structured folders.

The library is split into three independent sections — **Articles**, **Gallery**, and **Files** — each with its own page, filters, and upload flow (no shared tabs).

### Key Benefits

- **One place for everything** — no more hunting across folders, drives, and inboxes
- **Automatic organization** — numbered project folders and categorized subfolders are created without manual effort
- **Clean lifecycle management** — active projects stay easy to find; finished projects can be archived without losing structure
- **Built-in knowledge base** — a growing library of reference material, saved and organized alongside project work

A project management, contractor and task tracking system featuring 17 custom apps, an AI assistant with a command mode, and a modular HTMX-driven UI.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
npm run build
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_ai_providers   # seed AI provider list
python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Or run [install.bat](https://github.com/OlegUshakov-pl/CRM/blob/main/install.bat) for one-click setup (creates venv, installs Python + Node dependencies, builds Tailwind, runs migrations, seeds AI providers, collects static files, and creates a superuser). Default credentials: `admin` / `admin`.

Run `update.bat` after pulling new code to refresh dependencies and rebuild the frontend. Start the server anytime with `runserver.bat`.

```

The `Article`, `Photo`, and `FileDocument` models are proxies over `library.LibraryItem` — no extra tables, no data duplication. `Category` / `Tag` stay shared in `library`.

---

## File Storage

### Projects

Projects store files in organized directories:

```
{number}_{name}_Project/
  documents/
  drawings/
  models/
```

Subfolder naming is configurable via `AppSetting`. Storage backend uses custom `ProjectFileSystemStorage`.

### Library

Everything library-related lives in one root folder (configurable via `AppSetting` `storage.project_path`, falls back to `MEDIA_ROOT/library/`), next to the article folders:

```
{library_root}/
  files/                     # Uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, ...)
  images/                    # Gallery uploads, article covers, preview images
  {slug}_{YYYY-MM-DD}/
    {slug}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md   # Full article content in Markdown
    images/                  # Downloaded/copied article images
    attachments/             # Uploaded file attachments
```

- Content is stored both in the database (HTML) and as `.md` on disk
- Upload routing (`files/` vs `images/`) is extension-based; uploads use the custom `LibraryStorage` backend
- Uploads are served via the login-protected `/library/uploads/...` view with path traversal protection (not via `/media/`)
- Article folders are created on create/edit/import and recursively deleted on delete
- Article content images are served via a dedicated `/library/{slug}/image/{path}` view with path traversal protection
- Article **Picture** (cover) is set on the edit page, shown first on article cards (imported preview image is the fallback), and never appears in the Gallery
